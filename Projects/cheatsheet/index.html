        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of all web pages. 
            It was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 to define the structure of a web page. 
            Without it, you wouldn’t be able to organize text or add images or videos to your pages. 
            HTML is the beginning of everything you need to know to make your first website.

        <h2>TAGS</h2>
        <p>
            In HTML, tags are commonly defined as a set of characters constituting a formatted command for a web page. 
            They are used for making elements for the web page’s markup. During the early days of the World Wide Web, 
            tags were responsible for a majority of the web’s code.
        </p>
        <p>A single tag is made of an opening angle bracket <span>&lt;</span>, followed by the element-name, followed by the closing angle bracket. 
            While most elements are made of opening and closing tags some are self-closing. 
            Furthermore, some self-closing elements like <span>&lt;br&gt;</span> can have a slash at the end like so: <span>&lt;br /&gt;</span>. 
            The other self-closing tags include: <span>&lt;area&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;base&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;col&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;embed&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;hr&gt;</span>, 
            <span>&lt;img&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;input&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;keygen&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;link&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;meta&gt;</span>, 
            <span>&lt;param&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;source&gt;</span>, <span>&lt;track&gt;</span>, and <span>&lt;wbr&gt;</span>.

        <h2>HTML Tables</h2>
        <h3>What is a table?</h3>
        <p>A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). 
            A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data,
            for example a person and their age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML Table Structure</h3>
        <p>Tables are composed of multiple smaller types of elements that have special meaning within the table structure. 
            The elements that are used in the construction of a typical table are as follows:
        </p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>TAG</th>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td class="html">&lt;table&gt;</td>
                    <td class="table-t">TABLE</td>
                    <td>Serves as the container for all elements and information contained within the table including headers, columns, and rows.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="html">&lt;thead&gt;</td>
                    <td class="table-t">TABLE HEAD</td>
                    <td>The set of rows defining the column headers in a table.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="html">&lt;th&gt;</td>
                    <td class="table-t">TABLE HEADER</td>
                    <td>Is used to display data for a specific column header within a table.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="html">&lt;tbody&gt;</td>
                    <td class="table-t">TABLE BODY</td>
                    <td>The set of rows containing actual table data.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="html">&lt;tr&gt;</td>
                    <td class="table-t">TABLE ROW</td>
                    <td>The table row element, is used to display data within a row (horizontally) in a table.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="html">&lt;td&gt;</td>
                    <td class="table-t">TABLE DATA</td>
                    <td>The table data element, is used to display individual data within a specific row/column position in a table.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="html">&lt;tfoot&gt;</td>
                    <td class="table-t">TABLE FOOT</td>
                    <td>The set of rows defining the footer in a table.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h3>Table with Colspan</h3>
        <p>
            Colspan is an attribute which assigns multiple columns to a cell of a table.
             The number of columns depends on the value entered by you in <span>colspan=""</span> attribute.
        </p>
        <h3>Table with Rowspan</h3>
        <p>
            Rowspan in table, works similar to the clospan for columns, but here, we assign multiple rows to a cell using an attribute <span>rowspan=""</span>.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="css">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to style websites. 
            Colors, fonts, and page layouts for a site can all be managed using CSS. 
            The more comfortable you are with CSS, the better equipped you will be to create an appealing website. 
        </p>
        <h3>Selectors</h3>
        <p>Selectors are used to style HTML elements according to their type and/or attributes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>All markups can be selected with the <span>*</span> selector:</p>
                <img src="/Users/cgarcia/Web-develop/Projects/cheatsheet/resources/images/all-markups.png" alt="all-markups">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Selecting by Type: The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name. 
                    The element-type must be a valid HTML element.
                </p>
                <img src="/Users/cgarcia/Web-develop/Projects/cheatsheet/resources/images/element-type.png" alt="element-type">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Selecting by Attribute: The class selector selects elements that are assigned a class attribute, 
                    it can be used across multiple elements, and begins with a period, .. Similarly, the id selector selects an HTML element that 
                    has an id attribute. In contrast, the id selector can only be applied once and begins with the hashtag symbol, #.
                </p>
                <img src="/Users/cgarcia/Web-develop/Projects/cheatsheet/resources/images/select-attribute.png" alt="select-attribute">
                <p>
                    The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element. An element can be selected with a specific id, by using a hash (#) character, followed by id-name.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multiple class values can be assigned to a single element. Elements are selected by class with a period (.) character, followed by class-name. Unlike id values, class values can be duplicated on a page with different elements.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The CSS Grouping Selector: The grouping selector selects a group of HTML elements and applies a specific set of styles to each one of them, helping in minimizing the codebase.
                </p>
